## 🏆 Audit & Cyfrin Updraft Challenge NFTs / CTFs Achievements

- **Project:**
  - [Decentralized Lottery](https://github.com/0xusmanf/decentralized-lottery-with-foundry/edit/main/README.md)
    - A **provably fair**, **automated**, and **decentralized** lottery smart contract for Ethereum.  
Built with [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) and powered by [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf), [Chainlink Automation](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/introduction), and [Chainlink Price Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds).  
    - This project started as the [Cyfrin Foundry Smart Contract Lottery](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-smart-contract-lottery-cu) from the *Cyfrin Updraft* course, then evolved with new features, improved architecture, and more robust testing.
- **Audit Competitions:**
  - Participated in two public smart contract security contests, demonstrating a strong adversarial mindset.
  - Ranked **#239** in **CodeHawks**, with identifying valid high & low-severity vulnerabilities.
  - Engaging in **Code4rena** audits to strengthen high-stakes smart contract security expertise.
- **Cyfrin Updraft Challenge NFTs / CTFs:**
  - Exploited vulnerable smart contracts by developing and executing scripts for various attack vectors, including **reentrancy**, **integer overflows**, **oracle manipulation**, and **Delegatecall**.
  - Demonstrated security expertise by minting all challenge NFTs of Foundry and Security courses through smart contract exploitation.
  - On-Chain Proof: View minted NFTs on ZKsync Mainnet [(link)](https://www.oklink.com/zksync-era/address/0xa902fb9cdd94324c7380c7dacae428413db87b1e/assets/nft)
